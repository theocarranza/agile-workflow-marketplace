# Decomposition Rules

Self-contained rules for splitting a parent work item into Stories. These travel with the skill
so it needs no host-repo docs to function.

## Backlog hierarchy

```
Epic
  └─ Feature
       └─ Story  (User Story / Bug / Tech Debt / Spike)  ← the unit you create here
            └─ Task
```

- A **Story** is executable work that fits one sprint and yields exactly **1 Pull Request**.
  "Story" covers User Story, Bug, Tech Debt, Spike — same backlog rules.
- A Story's parent is its **Feature**, never the Epic directly.

## The sizing rule (the core judgment)

**1 Story = 1 sprint = 1 PR.** Split the parent so each Story honors this. If a candidate Story
would exceed the team's story-point ceiling (default ceiling: **5 points** — confirm with the host
team), split it further, or stage it into phases and carry later phases as separate Stories.

Each Story must trace to a **verbatim slice of the parent text**. If a slice has no Story, it is a
dropped requirement (caught in AUDIT). If a Story has no parent slice, it is scope creep.

## Story-point heuristic (6-driver MAX)

Score each driver 1/2/3/5; the Story's points = the **MAX** across drivers (not the sum). This keeps
one hard dimension from being diluted by easy ones.

| Driver       | 1                | 2                  | 3                       | 5                          |
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Escopo       | one tiny change  | one area           | multiple artifacts/area | multiple areas             |
| Incerteza    | known            | mostly known       | some unknowns           | significant unknowns       |
| Integrações  | none             | one stable         | a couple to integrate   | many / unstable            |
| Dados        | none             | trivial            | some shaping            | complex modeling/migration |
| QA           | trivial          | unit-level         | a flow                  | multi-screen E2E journey   |
| Rollout      | none             | flag/simple        | coordinated             | risky/irreversible         |

Record the per-driver scores and the MAX in the Story's Complexity section so the estimate is
auditable, e.g. `5 pts — driver: QA=5 (multi-screen E2E); Escopo=5; rest ≤3`.

## Definition of Ready (each Story must meet)

- [ ] Title states a clear objective (describe the need, not the solution; for Bugs, the defect).
- [ ] Detailed description (behaviors, scenarios, technical specs, affected areas).
- [ ] Story points set.
- [ ] Linked to a Feature.

## Parent-type branch

- Parent is a **Feature** → decompose straight into Stories.
- Parent is an **Epic** → STOP and ask: create the intervening Feature(s) first, or target an
  existing child Feature. Never attach a Story directly to an Epic.

## Provenance

Distilled from the originating team's `development-process.md` (hierarchy, DoR, story points) and
backlog-strategy guides. Values marked "default" / "confirm with host team" are tunable seams.
