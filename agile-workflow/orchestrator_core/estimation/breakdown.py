"""Task-level estimation for one User Story.

This is what runs when a Story is decomposed into Tasks, and again whenever that Task list
changes. It derives hours for every Task from the Story's points, splits them so the parts
sum to the whole, and checks the total against the assigned person's remaining capacity in
the active sprint.

Two rules shape the behaviour:

**Recomputed hours are written without asking, and always reported.** A Task list that
changed but kept its old hours is worse than one with no hours, because the burndown keeps
charting a plan nobody is following. So a recompute applies itself -- and every change is
named in the summary, so nothing moves silently.

**Capacity is a ceiling, not a note.** When the derived hours exceed what the assignee has
left, the run stops and asks for a decision rather than writing an estimate that cannot fit.
